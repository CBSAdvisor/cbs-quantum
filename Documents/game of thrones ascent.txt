An Honored Guest
 - "It is treason to support House Targaryen... but I have made your loyalties known. I am toild a Targaryen loyalist will visit soon. We should prepare."

 - "What sort of preparation did you have in mind?"
 - "A feast in his honor -- a quiet one, of course. And many improvements to your holdings. I have drawn up a list."
 - "Prepare as you would for any guest. Undue attention would not help our visitor's cause."

 - "What do you know of this mysterious visitor, maester?"
 - "It is not Viserys Targaryen, I know that much. He and his sister Daenerys remain out of reach. Perhaps this visitor knows more of them."
 - "See if you can learn more of this visitor. I want to be prepared when he arrives."

 - "What momentous news. I will make whatever arrangements you deem appropriate, maester."
 
  - Maester Lucas nods. "I will make discreet. In the mean time, I believe Ser Hugo has plans to spruce up your guar..."

A Feast for Dragons
  - "I cannot stay long. But my lord Viserys is grateful for your support, and promises to remember you when the usurper to gone."

  - "How can I best serve the Targaryens from here?"
  - "Obey King Robert and keep your true loyalties hidden. When the time is right, the Targariens will call upon you.
  - "I will be a loyal subject of King Robert, until the dragon returns"

  - "May I ask how House Targaryen fares?"
  - "Not much of a house anymore. Just Viserys, trying to raise an army to take back Westeros. He hopes to trade his sister for what he needs."
  - "I am not Viserys' only bannerman. More would swear fealty, if he revealed himself."

  - "I appreciate you coming all this way, Ser Jorah. Please, feast before you go."

  The knight nods. "It is a long journey back to Pentos. But if you have a banner, I will carry it with me, and present it to Viserys."
  
Интрига.

	они развили свой талант верности вассалу. Сила шпионажа Ваших Поклявшихся Мечей,
	выполняющих Действия Шпиона, равняется Spy Stats Вашего Персонажа (включая 
	Здания и Оборудование) и их собственное обучение и Оборудование. Любые премии
	проценты (например, от Талантов) для нападений или защиты тогда применены на 
	полный счет.

Sworn Swords.
  Sworn Swords are minor characters you can recruit to serve in your House, that
  can assist you to complete storyline Quests, Adventures, and to engage other
  Lords and Ladies in Player to Player Actions. Sworn Swords can be grouped together
  to form an Adventure Party, which allows you to send them quicker to Adventures.

  The number of Sworn Swords that you can send simultaneously for Adventures and 
  Player to Player Actions is equivalent to your number of Command Points. 
  Sworn Swords sent on Quests and Challenges are not limited this way.
  
  The very first Sworn Sword whose name starts with Helpful you're forced to buy 
  in the Prologue starts without any base stats despite being common quality.

  The Legendary Sworn Sword bought with 24 gold comes with 4 open seals and the 
  Peerless Sworn Sword bought with 35 gold comes with 5 open seals. It would cost 
  24 gold for getting the 4 seals and 35 for opening 5 seals, so these sworn swords 
  are essentially free if you plan on buying the seals any ways.
  
  Ranks
    Sworn Swords will gain XP whenever they succeed in Quests, Adventures or Player 
	to Player Actions. When they reach a certain amount of XP (see the table to the 
	right), the game will prompt you to train them. Training either gives +2 to a 
	Stat or +1% to a Substat.

    Also note that there are ranks where the Sworn Sword requires 0 XP to rank up. 
	For example, once your Sworn Sword reaches 335 XP, he/she will rank up to 8. 
	But to reach rank 9, he/she will need no more XP just another successful action 
	to trigger the "train" button again.
	
  Specialisations
    When your Sworn Sword reaches Rank 3, you will be able to select a specialisation 
	for your Sworn Sword per the standard conflict options.

    Battle Specialisations
      Vanguard (Fight)
      Skirmisher (Harass)
      Protector (Aid)
    Trade Specialiations
      Merchant (Barter)
      Charlatan (Swindle)
      Corruptor (Bribe)
    Intrigue Specialisations
      Agent (Spy)
      Saboteur (Sabotage)
      Thief (Steal)
    If you train your Sworn Sword in their Specialisation, this will increase the 
	percentage bonus they get, equal to the level of their Specialisation (e.g., if you 
	train one Specialisation five times, you Sworn Sword will have a +5% bonus bonus to 
	all actions with the related Substat). This means that you need to have a decent 
	amount base Battle, Trade and/or Intrigue Stat for percentages to become effective.

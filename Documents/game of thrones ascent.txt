"It is treason to support House Targaryen... but I have made your loyalties known. I am toild a Targaryen loyalist will visit soon. We should prepare."

"What sort of preparation did you have in mind?"
"A feast in his honor -- a quiet one, of course. And many improvements to your holdings. I have drawn up a list."
"Prepare as you would for any guest. Undue attention would not help our visitor's cause."
